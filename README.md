# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction

We use various Machine Learnig models to predict whether or not a credit card holder will default their credit card bill payment or not.

The dataset used is UCI_Credit_Card.csv. The dataset is freely available for use at <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset>. Please keep it in the same directory in which you run the jupyter notebook.

We use sklearn library of python and use the ML models : Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree and Neural Network to train and test our data.
